              My name is Henry Lin and I am a senior at Rowland High School. Currently I'm
              a track captain at rowland high school and my position is to lead the
              pole vaulters. As of now I hold a personal record of 13 ft. and 1.5 in.
              I aspire to be a computer engineer or a doctor. One of my favorite things are durian and
               Costco Wholesale because of the free samples. Also, I have two pets: a dog, Apollo,
              and a snail, Gerald. On my free time I enjoy watching animes and cartoons.<br>
