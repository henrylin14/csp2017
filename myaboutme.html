              My name is Henry Lin and I am a senior at Rowland High School. In the photo I am the Chinese person in the middle. I am a captain of the Rowland Track Team and I lead
              the pole vaulters and I have a 13 ft. and 1.5 in. person record. In the future I would like to be a computer engineer or a doctor. I like to eat durian and I have small feet. My favorite store is Costco because of the free samples. Also, I have a dog and a snail. My dogs name is Apollo
              and my snail do not have a name. I enjoy watching animes and cartoons.<br>
