              My first project is a remix of Maze Starter, which I worked with my partner Bryan.
              We decided to add more speed adjustments, levels, an introduction and rules.

              My following project is a remake of Pong and I was able to accomplish this with the
              help of my partner Bryan. We created a 2 player game that had several levels to adjust
              the speed of the ball. After, we finished the game I decided to go back to create a
              single player game. The hardest part was making the enemy computer follow and react to
              the position of the ball as well as making it possible for the user to win.
